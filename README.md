# Welcome to the Betalent Challenge Project!

This is a mobile app project created with Expo, a platform for developing mobile apps that allows you to create apps for Android, iOS, and the web.

## About the Project

The goal of this project is to create an app that allows users to view and interact with a list of employees. The app is divided into different sections, including a home screen, an employee list screen, and an employee details screen.

## Technologies Used

* Expo: a platform for developing mobile apps
* React Native: a framework for developing mobile apps
* JavaScript: the programming language used to develop the app
* TypeScript: the programming language used to develop the app
* React: a library of components used to develop the app

## How to Start

Open the terminal and run the command below to install the necessary dependencies:

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

   This will start the app on a local development server.

### 3. Open the App on an Emulator or Physical Device
To open the app on an emulator or physical device, you will need to follow the steps below:

Web: just click W in the terminal
Android: open the Android Studio emulator and run the command npx expo start --android.
iOS: open the Xcode emulator and run the command npx expo start --ios.
Physical Device: download the Expo Go app on your physical device ([`android `](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&hl=pt_BR) or [`IOS `](https://apps.apple.com/br/app/expo-go/id982107779)) and scan the QR code that will appear in the terminal when you run the app.
